# Monitoring and Observability with Selenium Workshop


## (1) Workshop Intro üß†

### (1.1) Introduction üëã
A [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) exporter that collects [Selenium Grid](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/grid/) metrics is the first part of the workshop. The second part will focus on creating and visualizing testing metrics for your E2E UI functional tests. 

Observability is a must have nowadays that modern web applications are more complex than ever. But what exactly we mean to have observability in our testing infrastructure?

Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It can produce charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. Participants will use docker compose to install locally a demo environment.

**Objectives:**

* Prometheus fundamentals and basics
* Pushgateway for collecting metrics
* AlertManager to alert engineering teams upon downtimes
* Selenium Grid Exporter & Grafana
* Visualizing testing metrics for your E2E UI functional testing suites

### (1.2) Prerequisites üóíÔ∏è

We need requirements to follow the hands-on lab today

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### (1.3) Playground ‚öΩ

First of all, clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:Athens-SDET-Meetup/selenium_observability_workshop.git

## (2) Foundations üèõÔ∏è

### (2.1) Prometheus & Pushgateway üìä

In this first section let us review how you can actually push metrics and scrap metrics from Pushgateway. 

![gateway](./images/gateway.png)

First we need to define the target in prometheus.yml file like host.docker.internal instead of localhost to be able to access it as its running within a docker container.

```javascript
  - job_name: 'Pushgateway'
    honor_labels: true
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['host.docker.internal:9091']
```

Now in order to start scrapping data let's push some in pushgateway!

Execute the following curl command:

Push a single sample into the group identified by {job="selenium"}:

```javascript
  echo "total_tests 15" | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/selenium
```

Now open prometheus and query to fetch the data:

![total_tests](./images/total_tests.png)

The scraping config is working as expected ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥!!! 

Let's add some visualizations around these metrics in our Grafana instance. 
For that we need to execute PromQL and we use also the pie chart panel.

### (2.2) Selenium Grid Exporter ‚öõÔ∏è

In this section we will deep dive into the implementation of the Selenium Grid Exporter to see what sort of metrics we can extract from Selenium Grid. 

The architecture is the following:

![grid_exporter](./images/grid_exporter.png)

The metrics exposed from Selenium Grid Exporter:

```javascript
# HELP selenium_grid_hub_sessionCount number of active sessions
# TYPE selenium_grid_hub_sessionCount gauge
selenium_grid_hub_sessionCount 0
# HELP selenium_grid_hub_maxSession number of max sessions
# TYPE sselenium_grid_hub_maxSession gauge
selenium_grid_hub_maxSession 0
# HELP selenium_grid_hub_totalSlots total number of slots
# TYPE selenium_grid_hub_totalSlots gauge
selenium_grid_hub_totalSlots 8
# HELP selenium_grid_hub_sessionQueueSize number of session in queue
# TYPE selenium_grid_hub_sessionQueueSize gauge
selenium_grid_hub_sessionQueueSize 0
# HELP selenium_grid_up was the last scrape of Selenium Grid successful.
# TYPE selenium_grid_up gauge
selenium_grid_up 1
```
You can of course query them in Prometheus directly:

![grid_metrics](./images/grid_metrics.png)

### (2.3) Alerting ‚ö†Ô∏è

Now that exporter is up and running we will see how to alert teams for any downtimes. The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

We will be using Slack for our workshop so we need to create first a Slack Incoming WebHook as Incoming webhooks are a way to post messages from apps into Slack. Creating an incoming webhook gives you a unique URL to which you send a JSON payload with the message text and some options. You can use all the usual formatting and layout blocks with incoming webhooks to make the messages stand out.

Follow instructions from [Slack WebHooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) on how to set up and extract the token.

Next we need to add the token in the alertmanager.yml as well as define the channel you created to spawn alerts!

![code](./images/code.png)

Now to test our integration let's bring down Selenium Grid! We hope a new Slack Alert will be generated within 30 seconds!

![alert](./images/alert.png)

### (2.4) Dashboards üìà

Now it's time to visualize the metrics in Grafana using some nice visualization panels. 

We can use the same approach and build our own queries to enable monitoring up time of Selenium Grid.

## (3) Selenium Testing üß™

In this workshop we will run a basic set of UI tests and review how we can integrate Grafana stack to our existing functional tests

### (3.1) TestNG & Prometheus üîé

Prometheus & Pushgateway come with a java client in order to integrate it in Java Maven Project. 
Just add the following to your project to get you started:

```javascript
     <dependency>
        <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId>
        <artifactId>simpleclient</artifactId>
        <version>0.16.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.prometheus</groupId>
        <artifactId>simpleclient_pushgateway</artifactId>
        <version>0.16.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

First we need to think what we need to push as metrics:

* **Failed Tests**
* **Passed Tests**
* **Skipped Tests**
* **Total Tests**

And how we can access them runtime? We will use of course TestNG listeners to listen to runtime events from the test execution. Create a Listener that extends the default TestNG one.


```java
public class PrometheusListeners implements ITestListener {
  ```

Now we need to initialize the metrics like the below ones:

```java
    List<String> labelKeys = Arrays.asList("author");
    List<String> labelValues = Arrays.asList("...");

    PushGateway client = new PushGateway("localhost:9091");
    CollectorRegistry registry = CollectorRegistry.defaultRegistry;

    String jobName = "selenium";
    String passed = "TestPassed";

    Gauge passedTests = Gauge.build()
            .name(passed)
            .help(help)
            .labelNames(labelKeys.toArray(new String[0]))
            .register(registry);
  ```
We will use Gauge type of metrics to autoincrement the value within the listener. For example we can listen to successful execution of tests and increment the value on the gauge metric.

```java
@Override
    public void onTestSuccess(ITestResult result) {
        passedTests.labels(labelValues.toArray(new String[0])).inc();
        stream.log(String.format("Successful test %s", result.getName()));
        try {
            client.push(registry, jobName);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            stream.log(String.format("Exception pushing metrics to Pushgateway %s", e.getMessage()));
        }
    }
```

Now running the tests we can actually start get metrics for the number of tests executing runtime.

![tests_passed](./images/TestsPassed.png)

### (3.2) Webdriver & Loki üìÅ

Prometheus is all about metrics but Loki is for logs. And we can start storing logs from our test projects pretty straightforward.

```java
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.mjfryc</groupId>
        <artifactId>mjaron-tinyloki-java</artifactId>
        <version>0.3.11</version>
    </dependency>
```

Tiny Grafana Loki client (log sender) written in pure Java 1.8 without any external dependencies.

- Implements JSON variant of Loki API
- Works with Android and Java SE
- Thread safe

We can initialize the client to send logs to Loki 

```java
private LogController logController = TinyLoki
        .withUrl("http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push")
        .start();

private ILogStream stream = logController.stream()
        .info()
        .l("conference", "AutomationStar")
        .build();
```

Now just execute the following command to push logs to Loki:
```java
stream.log(String message);
```
